# Goal is to clone out the UI of Bit.ly for my site with the following mvp:

##Shorten links on the homepage
##Register and login
##As a registered user you can save your shortened links, modify saved links to get a new shortened link, and delete saved shortened links
##The site will also be responsive
##There will be cross-browser compatibility, accessibility (ADA compliance, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) where applicable)
